# Grades Calculator

A simple calculator designed to help compute and track academic grades based on
user input.

## Overview
This project was built to practise basic programming logic and handling user
input. The calculator allows users to enter grades and receive a calculated
result, making it easier to understand overall performance.

It was created as part of my personal learning and portfolio development.

## Features
- Accepts user input for grades
- Performs basic calculations
- Outputs a final result clearly
- Simple and easy-to-use design

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser

No additional setup is required.

## Planned Improvements
- Support for multiple modules or weighting
- Improved validation for inputs
- Better UI feedback and error handling

## What I Learned
- Implementing calculation logic
- Handling user input in a small project
- Structuring a simple front-end application
